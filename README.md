# CS210-Project
This project forecasts PM2.5 air pollution levels in urban areas using real-time weather and pollutant data. It was created for the CS210: Databases & Data Science course. The Python script (Air Quality Forecasting (1).py) collects data from the OpenAQ and Meteostat APIs, cleans and merges it, creates visualizations, and prepares it for modeling. The SQL file (air_quality_schema (1).sql) sets up a PostgreSQL database with tables for pollution, weather, and merged data, including a sample query. The final report (Manav Jhala Final Report CS210 (1).pdf) explains the full pipeline, methods used, results, and takeaways. The project achieved strong predictive accuracy using a Random Forest model, with an RÂ² score of 0.78.
